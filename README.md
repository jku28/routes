# routes
### The js files are routes for the API. The mongo server is jk208.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/birdwatch
### The http requests require the route file in the url. For example, to get /birdlist in bird.js, you must use jk208.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/birdwatch/birds/birdlist 
### The same is for user.js routes. For example: jk208.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/birdwatch/users/login/:id/:password
